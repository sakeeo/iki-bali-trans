                    <p>In addition to the beauty of the natural scenery of Nusa Penida that you can see from the mainland, the beauty of the underwater scenery of Nusa Penida also attracts many tourist visits. For now, there are two most effective ways to see the underwater scenery of Nusa Penida. Namely, snorkeling and scuba diving.</p><p>

The location between the three Nusa islands is very close and separated by sea waters that are not too wide. So, when you do snorkeling on the island of Nusa Penida, chances are you have also done snorkeling on the island of Nusa Lembongan or the island of Nusa Ceningan.
</p><p>
Several snorkeling spots on the island of Nusa Penida offer fairly calm sea currents, although the currents can change at any time. In addition, the visibility when snorkeling is quite good, around 10 meters to 20 meters during the day, especially during the dry season.</p>
